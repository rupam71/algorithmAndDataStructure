An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations. 

The array has a fixed size meaning once the size is given to it, it cannot be changed i.e. you canâ€™t shrink it nor can you expand it.

There are majorly three types of arrays:
    One-dimensional array (1-D arrays): 1d array as a row, where elements are stored one after another.
    Two-dimensional (2D) array: Multidimensional arrays can be considered as an array of arrays or as a matrix consisting of rows and columns.
    Three-dimensional array: A 3-D Multidimensional array contains three dimensions, so it can be considered an array of two-dimensional arrays.

In computer programming, a data type is a classification of data that determines the type of values that can be stored, manipulated, and processed.

A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

Time complexity:
    Algo.           Avg case	worst case
    accessing       O(1)        O(1)
    searching       O(n)        O(n)
    insertion       O(n)        O(n)
    deletion        O(n)        O(n)

Space Complexity at worst case for creating an array is O(N)

Is Array Data Type or Data Structure?
    Array is undoubtedly a Data Structure because It can store values of any data type which we can access, delete and update the existing values also we can add on new values into it. Hence array is a Data Structure and not a Data Type.
