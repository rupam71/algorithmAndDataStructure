/*

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):
    This principle advocates simplicity in design. It suggests that systems 
    and designs should be as simple as necessary, avoiding unnecessary 
    complexity.

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
    Encourages the elimination of redundancy in code. If a piece of code is 
    repeated, it should be abstracted into a reusable function or module.

YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):
    Advises against adding functionality until it is necessary. This 
    principle encourages developers to avoid over-engineering by 
    implementing only the features that are currently required.
