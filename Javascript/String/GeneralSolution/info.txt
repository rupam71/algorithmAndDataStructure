It's great that you've covered those 10 string algorithms! Here are some more string algorithms that you might find interesting and useful:

1. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS): 
        Find the length of the longest subsequence that two strings share.
2. Longest Palindromic Substring: 
        Find the longest substring in a given string that is also a palindrome.
3. Rabin-Karp Algorithm: 
        A string searching algorithm that uses hashing to find patterns in a text efficiently.
4. Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm (KMP): 
        A string searching algorithm that finds occurrences of a pattern in a text without unnecessary comparisons.
5. Boyer-Moore Algorithm: 
        Another efficient string searching algorithm that preprocesses the pattern to skip sections of the text where a match cannot occur.
6. Suffix Array: 
        A data structure that stores all the suffixes of a given string in sorted order, useful for various string manipulation tasks.
7. Suffix Tree: 
        A more advanced data structure for efficient string searching and manipulation.
8. Manacher's Algorithm: 
        An algorithm to find the longest palindromic substring with linear time complexity.
9. Z Algorithm: 
        A linear time string matching algorithm that finds all occurrences of a pattern in a text.
10. Regular Expressions Matching: 
        Implementing regular expression pattern matching for string validation or extraction.
11. Aho-Corasick Algorithm: 
        An efficient algorithm for finding multiple patterns in a text simultaneously.
12. Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) Compression: 
        A lossless data compression algorithm used in various file formats.
13. Run-Length Encoding: 
        A simple compression algorithm that replaces sequences of repeated characters with a single instance and a count.
14. Boyer-Moore-Horspool Algorithm: 
        A simplified version of the Boyer-Moore algorithm for string searching.
15. Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT): 
        A reversible transformation of a string that often precedes compression algorithms like the Burrows-Wheeler Transform.
16. Edit Distance with Alignment: 
        Extending the Edit Distance algorithm to find the actual sequence of edit operations that transform one string into another.
17. Minimum Window Substring: 
        Find the minimum window in a string that contains all characters of another given string.
18. Palindromic Substrings: 
        Count or find all palindromic substrings within a given string.
19. String Matching with Wildcards: 
        Implement string matching where the pattern can contain wildcard characters like '*' and '?'.
20. String Hashing: 
        Using hash functions to compare and analyze strings efficiently.

Remember that some of these algorithms might have specific use cases or prerequisites, so make sure to study their details and understand when and how to apply them effectively.
