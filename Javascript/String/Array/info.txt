        Given an array representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed.
27. Next Permutation: 
        Rearrange numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation.
28. Subarray Sum Equals K: 
        Given an array of integers, find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals a specific value k.
29. Sort Colors: 
        Sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s in linear time.
30. Counting Elements:
